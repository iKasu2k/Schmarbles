    <h4>A small bot to join Marbles on Stream in specified Twitch Channels whenever other people write !play</h4>
</center>

## Why Schmarbles :question:
I really enjoy looking at a Marble with my name in the stream I'm watching, but to be honest, when interacting
with the community, I often get distracted and forget to write !play. To circumvent this issue, I've written
this small bot to join the channel I watch and write !play for me. 

:important: I'm not interested to add any additional functionality as the only purpose is to write 
play when I forget to do so. Feel free to do so by yourself, I'm not here to judge.
